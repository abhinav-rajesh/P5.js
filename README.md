balls that bounce around the canvas, are a ected by gravity, and allow for dynamic 
changes in their color and size. Multiple balls are present, and each ball has unique 
speed and size characteristics.

o the edges.
Speed Control: Balls move at varying speeds and bounce o the canvas edges 
with realistic behavior.
Color & Size Change: Pressing any key changes the color and size of all the balls on 
the screen.
Multiple Balls: The program features multiple balls that behave independently, 
each with its own size, speed, and color.
